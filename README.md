### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

PHP Developer, with over 15 years of experience in building web sites and web applications using technologies like PHP, MySQL / MariaDB, Apache / Nginx, JavaScript, REST API, Elasticsearch and more.

I also have experience with media and web design (UI, UX, vector graphics, publishing and so on), as well as some experience with Digital Marketing and SEO, although my real passion is programming and building web applications.

I am proactive and I like to participate in all phases of a project, from idea, through specification and implementation, be it visual (frontend) or functional (backend, or full-stack). I enjoy working with people from all specializations inside a team or a company and I am a firm believer in quick, honest feedback and iterative design.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of technologies I'm working with:
- Frontend: Bootstrap, JavaScript / jQuery, Vue.js, CSS, HTML
- Backend: PHP, Laravel, SQL, Elasticsearch, Linux / Shell / SSH / FTP
- Tools: PhpStorm, Azure Data Studio, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Premiere Pro, CorelDRAW! 

I am not limited to using only these tools however. I am always open to learning new technologies and using new tools, especially if they are the right tool for the job.
